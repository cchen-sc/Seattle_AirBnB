## Installation
python3 is needed for data analysis.

## Project Motivation
This project is to explore the Seattle Airbnb Open Data shared on Kaggle. I am interested in getting informations to help self trip planners for visiting Seattle:
1. When is a good time to visit with limited budget?
2. Should I care about the square feet of the place? 
3. Which region should I search for a place on AirBnB?
4. What type of room can I choose?

## File Descriptions
The data foler folder contains the data downloaded from Kaggle: data_Seattle 
There is one notbook file with all the details of analysisL Seattle_AirBnB.ipynb


## Results
The main findings can be found in this [blog] (https://medium.com/@kola.hu.2021/planning-a-trip-to-seattle-e32c40cc7b08).
